# LungCancerDetection_CNN_SVM_ML
2 Machine Learning Models were created. One Convolutional Neural Network and one Support Vector Machine. These models were created to compare the performance of predictive models on detecting various forms of Lung cancer. The Convolutional Neural Network makes use of the VGG 16 model as the base model in place using Transfer learning techniques.
